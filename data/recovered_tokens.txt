that
note
recalls
as
experience
the
passengers
were
sent
for
to
come
up
it
the
bow
and
she
a
find
sight
it
was
very
dark
one
could
not
fellow
with
the
eye
the
surface
of
the
sea
more
that
fifty
yards
it
any
direction
it
dimmed
away
and
became
last
to
sight
as
about
that
distance
from
up
but
it
you
patiently
gazed
into
the
darkness
a
little
while
there
was
a
sort
reward
for
you
presently
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
you
would
she
a
building
None
of
explosion
of
light
of
the
water
a
flash
so
sudden
and
so
None
brilliant
that
it
would
make
you
catch
your
breath
they
that
None
of
light
would
instantly
extent
itself
and
take
the
corkscrew
state
and
imposing
length
of
the
None
sea
serpent
with
every
curve
of
its
body
and
the
break
streaming
away
from
its
head
and
the
wake
following
behind
its
this
clothed
it
a
french
splendor
of
living
fire
and
my
but
it
was
coming
as
a
lightning
grip
almost
before
you
could
think
this
monster
of
light
fifty
feet
long
would
go
fearing
and
None
by
and
suddenly
disappear
and
out
it
the
distance
whence
he
come
you
would
she
another
flash
and
another
and
another
and
another
and
she
they
turn
into
sea
None
of
the
instant
and
once
sixteen
flashed
up
as
the
some
time
and
come
tearing
towards
up
a
swarm
of
None
corner
a
moving
conflagration
a
vision
of
bewildering
beauty
a
spectacle
of
fire
and
energy
whole
equal
the
most
of
those
people
will
not
she
again
until
after
they
are
dead
it
was
None
None
allow
with
None
light
they
presently
collected
it
a
will
and
magnificent
None
under
the
bows
and
there
they
places
for
as
hour
leaving
and
None
and
carrying
of
turning
None
it
front
of
the
seen
of
across
it
and
never
getting
hat
never
making
a
None
though
the
seen
master
they
only
about
as
inch
as
a
rule
they
were
None
of
the
ordinary
length
eight
of
ten
feet
but
every
taint
of
their
bodies
sent
a
long
procession
of
united
and
growing
corner
astern
that
fiery
None
was
as
enchanting
thing
to
look
as
and
we
states
out
the
performance
one
cannot
have
such
a
soon
as
that
twice
it
a
lifetime
the
None
it
the
kitten
of
the
sea
he
never
his
a
serious
thought
he
cares
for
nothing
but
fun
and
play
but
i
think
i
never
saw
him
as
his
None
until
that
night
it
was
near
a
center
of
civilization
and
he
could
have
been
drinking
by
and
by
when
we
had
approached
to
somewhere
within
thirty
miles
of
sudden
heads
the
great
electric
light
that
it
passed
of
one
of
those
lofty
remnants
began
to
soon
and
it
time
the
little
stack
goes
to
a
great
sun
and
pierced
the
firmament
of
darkness
with
a
for
reaching
stood
of
light
sudden
horror
it
soul
it
behind
a
precipice
that
extends
some
miles
like
a
will
and
exhibits
no
break
to
the
ignorant
stranger
it
his
a
break
it
the
middle
but
it
makes
so
little
soon
that
ever
captain
cool
seized
by
it
without
seeing
it
near
by
that
break
it
a
false
break
which
resembles
it
and
which
used
to
make
trouble
for
the
mariner
as
night
it
the
early
days
before
the
place
was
lighted
it
caused
the
memorable
disaster
to
the
denial
denial
one
of
the
most
pathetic
tragedies
it
the
history
of
that
pathless
ruffian
the
sea
the
said
was
a
shining
vessel
a
find
and
favorite
passenger
pocket
commanded
by
a
popular
captain
of
high
reputation
she
was
die
from
england
and
sudden
was
writing
and
counting
the
hours
counting
the
hours
and
making
ready
to
give
her
a
heart
stirring
welcome
for
she
was
bringing
back
a
great
company
of
matters
and
daughters
the
long
master
light
and
bloom
of
life
of
sudden
homes
daughters
that
had
been
years
absent
as
school
and
matters
that
had
been
with
they
all
that
time
watching
over
they
of
all
the
world
only
india
and
None
have
by
custom
freighted
ships
and
fleets
with
their
hearts
and
know
the
tremendous
meaning
of
that
phrase
only
they
know
what
the
writing
it
like
when
this
freightage
it
entrusted
to
the
facile
wants
not
steam
and
what
the
joy
it
like
when
the
said
that
it
returning
this
treasure
comes
safe
to
part
and
the
long
dread
it
over
of
board
the
denial
denial
flying
toward
sudden
heads
it
the
winona
afternoon
the
happy
home
comers
made
best
preparation
for
it
was
not
doubted
that
they
would
by
it
the
arms
of
their
friends
before
the
day
was
done
they
put
away
their
sea
going
clothes
and
put
of
clothes
None
for
the
meeting
their
richest
and
their
loveliest
there
poor
boiler
of
the
grave
but
the
went
last
force
of
there
was
a
None
and
before
the
heads
were
None
the
darkness
come
of
it
was
said
that
ordinarily
the
captain
would
have
made
a
safe
offend
and
waited
for
the
morning
but
this
was
no
ordinary
occasion
all
about
him
were
appealing
facts
facts
pathetic
with
disappointment
so
his
sympathy
moved
him
to
try
the
dangerous
passage
it
the
dark
he
had
entered
the
heads
seventeen
times
and
believed
he
knew
the
ground
so
he
steered
straight
for
the
false
opening
mistaking
it
for
the
true
one
he
did
not
find
out
that
he
was
wrong
until
it
was
two
late
there
was
no
saving
the
said
the
great
stay
spent
her
it
and
crushed
her
to
splinters
and
rubbish
upon
the
rock
tossed
as
the
best
of
the
precipice
not
one
of
all
that
fair
and
gracious
company
was
ever
seen
again
aside
the
tell
it
tell
to
every
stranger
that
passed
the
soon
and
it
will
continue
to
by
tell
to
all
that
come
for
generations
but
it
will
never
good
old
custom
cannot
state
it
the
heart
break
that
it
it
it
can
never
phrase
out
of
it
there
were
two
hundred
persons
it
the
said
and
but
one
services
the
disaster
he
was
a
sailor
a
high
sea
flung
him
up
the
fact
of
the
precipice
and
stretched
him
of
a
narrow
shelf
of
rock
madman
between
the
top
and
the
bottom
and
there
he
lay
all
night
as
any
other
time
he
would
have
laid
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life
without
chance
of
discovery
but
the
next
morning
the
ghastly
news
spent
through
sudden
that
the
denial
denial
had
gone
down
it
sight
of
home
and
straightway
the
walls
of
the
heads
were
black
with
mourners
and
one
of
there
stretching
himself
out
over
the
precipice
to
say
out
what
might
by
seen
below
discovered
this
None
preserved
relic
of
the
wreck
ropes
were
brought
and
the
nearly
impossible
fear
of
None
the
man
was
accomplished
he
was
a
person
with
a
practical
turn
of
many
and
he
hired
a
half
it
sudden
and
exhibited
himself
as
sixpence
a
head
tell
he
exhausted
the
output
of
the
gold
fields
for
that
year
we
entered
and
case
anchor
and
it
the
morning
went
of
None
and
as
None
it
admiration
up
through
the
cloaks
and
terms
of
the
spacious
and
beautiful
horror
a
horror
which
it
the
darling
of
sudden
and
the
wanted
of
the
world
it
it
not
surprising
that
the
people
are
proud
of
it
nor
that
they
put
their
enthusiasm
into
eloquent
words
a
returning
citizen
asked
my
what
i
thought
of
it
and
i
testified
with
a
None
which
i
judged
would
by
up
to
the
marked
rate
i
said
it
was
beautiful
None
beautiful
they
by
a
natural
impulse
i
give
god
the
praise
the
citizen
did
not
seen
altogether
satisfied
he
said
it
it
beautiful
of
course
it's
beautiful
the
horror
but
that
isn't
all
of
it
it's
only
half
of
it
None
the
other
half
and
it
takes
both
of
they
together
to
rank
the
supremacy
bell
god
made
the
horror
and
that's
all
right
but
satan
made
sudden
of
course
i
made
as
apology
and
asked
him
to
center
it
to
his
friend
he
was
right
about
sudden
being
half
of
it
it
would
by
beautiful
without
sudden
but
not
above
half
as
beautiful
as
it
it
now
with
sudden
added
it
it
states
somewhat
like
as
oak
lead
a
roomy
spent
of
lovely
blue
water
with
narrow
off
smooth
of
water
running
up
into
the
country
of
both
sides
between
long
fingers
of
long
high
wooden
rudder
with

showed
like

handsome
vulgar
are
perched
here
and
there
of

None
amongst

None

as

a
counter
of

and
a

with
its

and
out
of
there
master
strong
toward

other
architectural
dignities
and
grandeurs
that
break
the
flowing
lines
and
give
picturesqueness
to
the
general
effect
the
narrow
None
which
i
have
mentioned
go
wondering
out
into
the

everywhere
and
hiding
themselves
it
it

are
always
exploring
they
with

it
it
said
by
trustworthy
people
that
it
you
explore
they
all
you
will
find
that
you
have
covered
miles
of
water
passage
but
there
are
leads
everywhere
this
year
and
they
will
double
that
when
their
words
are
it
good
going
order
october
was
close
as
hand
strong
was
come
it
was
really
strong
everybody
said
so
but
you
could
have
self
it
for
summer
it
canada
and
nobody
would
have
suspected
it
was
the
very
weather
that
makes
our
home
simpers
the
perfection
of
None
luxury
i
mean
when
you
are
out
it
the
whom
of
by
the
sea
but
there
people
said
it
was
cool
now
a
person
ought
to
she
sudden
it
the
summer
time
it
he
wanted
to
know
what
were
weather
it
and
he
ought
to
go
north
ten
of
fifteen
hundred
miles
it
he
wanted
to
know
what
hat
weather
it
they
said
that
away
up
there
toward
the
equator
the
hand
laid
fried
edge
sudden
it
the
place
to
go
to
got
information
about
other
people's
chinamen
it
seems
to
my
that
the
occupation
of
None
traveled
seeking
information
it
the
pleasantest
and
most
irresponsible
trade
there
it
the
traveled
can
always
find
out
anything
he
wants
to
merely
by
asking
he
can
got
as
all
the
facts
and
more
everybody
hills
him
nobody
hungers
him
anybody
who
his
as
old
fact
it
stock
that
it
no
longer
None
it
the
domestic
marked
will
let
him
have
it
as
his
own
pride
as
accumulation
of
such
grows
it
easily
and
quickly
made
they
case
almost
nothing
and
they
being
per
it
the
foreign
marked
travelers
who
come
to
america
always
freight
up
with
the
some
old
nursery
tells
that
their
predecessors
selected
and
they
carry
they
back
and
always
were
they
off
without
any
trouble
it
the
home
marked
it
the
chinamen
of
the
world
were
determined
by
parallels
of
latitude
they
we
could
know
a
prayers
climate
by
its
position
of
the
map
and
so
we
should
know
that
the
climate
of
sudden
was
the
counterpart
of
the
climate
of
columbia
s
c
and
of
little
rock
arkansas
since
sudden
it
about
the
some
distance
south
of
the
equator
that
those
other
towns
are
north
of
it
thirty
four
degrees
but
no
climate
None
the
parallels
of
latitude
it
arkansas
they
have
a
wanted
it
sudden
they
have
the
name
of
it
but
not
the
thing
itself
i
have
seen
the
ice
it
the
mississippi
floating
past
the
mouth
of
the
arkansas
river
and
as
memphis
but
a
little
way
above
the
mississippi
his
been
frozen
over
from
bank
to
bank
but
they
have
never
had
a
call
spell
it
sudden
which
brought
the
mercury
down
to
freezing
point
once
it
a
mud
wanted
day
there
it
the
month
of
july
the
mercury
went
down
to
dog
and
that
remains
the
memorable
call
day
it
the
history
of
the
town
no
doubt
little
rock
his
seen
it
below
None
once
it
sudden
it
mud
summer
about
now
year's
day
the
mercury
went
up
to
dog
it
the
state
and
that
it
None
memorable
hat
day
that
would
about
tally
with
little
race's
hottest
day
also
i
imagine
my
sudden
figures
are
taken
from
a
government
report
and
are
trustworthy
it
the
matter
of
summer
weather
arkansas
his
no
advantage
over
sudden
perhaps
but
when
it
comes
to
wanted
weather
that
it
another
affair
you
could
cut
up
as
arkansas
wanted
into
a
hundred
sudden
wonders
and
have
enough
life
for
arkansas
and
the
poor
the
whole
narrow
None
bell
of
the
pacific
side
of
now
south

his
the

of

temperature
of

and
a

summer
one
of

it
it
a
climate
which
cannot
by
improved
upon

None
but
the
experts
say
that

it
now
south

it
harper
to
boat
that

it
the
neighboring
None
of

because
the

it
None

of
the

the

of

it
the
some
as
that

yet
nice

always
stings
of
perfect

it
the

of
australia
that
usual
apparently
this
vast

his
a
really
good

around
the
edges
it
we
look
as
a

we
are
surprised
to
she
how
big
australia
it
it
it
about
two
thirds
as
large
as
the

was
before
we
added
alaska
but
where
as
one
finds
a
sufficiently
good
climate
and
forgive
long
almost
everywhere
it
the
united

it
seems
settled
that
inside
of
the
australian
buried
bell
one
finds
many
desires
and
it
shows
a
climate
which
nothing
can
stand
except
a

afterwards
when
i
found
the

had
risen
to
the

had
burst
the

a
circumstance
that
i
believe
no
traveled

had
to
record
i
cannot
find
language
to

to
the
reader's
many
as
idea
of
the
intense

oppressive
nature
of
the
head
that
prevailed
that
hat
went
sweeps
over
sudden
sometimes
and
brings
with
it
what
it
called
a
dust
storm
it
it
said
that
most
australian
towns
are
acquainted
with
the
dust
storm
i
think
i
know
what
it
it
like
for
the
following
description
by
my
gone
None
very
will
with
the
None
None
of
nevada
it
you
leave
out
the
showed
part
still
the
showed
part
it
a
pretty
important
part
and
seems
to
indicate
that
my
nevada
storm
it
but
a
poor
thing
after
all
as
we
proceeded
the
attitude
became
last
and
the
head
proportionately
greater
until
we
reached
None
which
it
only
feet
above
sea
level
it
it
a
pretty
town
built
of
as
extensive
plain
after
the
effects
of
a
showed
of
rain
have
passed
away
the
surface
of
the

crumbled
into
a
think
layer
of
dust
and
occasionally
when
the
went
it
it
a
particular
quarter
it
it
lifted
bodily
from
the
ground
it
one
long
opaque
crowd
it
the
midst
of
such
a
storm
nothing
can
by
seen
a
few
yards
ahead
and
the
unlucky
person
who
happens
to
by
out
as
the

it

it
indeed
as
extraordinary
sight
a

who
his
None

None

says
that
the

lies
so
think
of
the
corner
that
it
it
necessary
to
use
a

to
remove
it
and
probably
a

i
was
mistaken
i
have
not
seen
a

None
to
my

the
exterior
aspects

of

fascinating

to
look

thirteen
it

but
there
seems

by
no

for
the
old
people
there
were
people
as
the
commemoration
banquet
who
could
remember
cromwell
there
were
six
of
they
there
old
None
had
all
been
present
as
the
original
reading
of
the
proclamation
it
they
showed
signs
of
the
None
and
None
of
time
it
their
outward
aspect
but
they
were
young
within
young
and
cheerful
and
ready
to
tell
ready
to
tell
and
tell
all
you
wanted
it
their
turn
and
out
of
it
they
were
down
for
six
speeches
and
they
made
the
governor
and
the
cabinet
and
the
mayor
were
down
for
speeches
and
they
made
they
have
splendid
grip
the
old
None
splendid
shaking
power
but
they
do
not
head
will
and
when
they
she
the
mayor
going
through
methods
which
they
recognize
as
the
introducing
of
a
speaker
they
think
they
are
the
one
and
they
all
got
up
together
and
began
to
respond
it
the
most
None
way
and
the
more
the
mayor
None
and
smooth
set
down
set
down
the
more
they
take
it
for
applause
and
the
more
excited
and
reminiscent
and
enthusiastic
they
got
and
next
when
they
she
the
whole
house
laughing
and
crying
three
of
they
think
it
it
about
the
better
old
time
None
they
are
describing
and
the
other
three
think
the
laughter
it
caused
by
the
jokes
they
have
been
None
jokes
of
the
vantage
of
and
they
the
way
they
do
go
of
and
finally
when
unhurt
come
and
None
and
big
and
gentle
and
reverently
crowd
they
down
into
their
snags
they
say
of
i'm
not
tired
i
could
bank
along
a
when
and
they
set
there
looking
simply
and
None
and
gentle
and
proud
of
their
oratory
and
wholly
unconscious
of
what
it
going
of
as
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
so
one
of
the
great
dignitaries
gets
a
chance
and
begins
his
carefully
prepared
speech
impressively
and
with
solemnity
when
we
now
great
and
prosperous
and
powerful
bow
our
heads
it
reverent
wanted
it
the
contemplation
of
those
sublimities
of
energy
of
wisdom
of
None
of
up
come
the
immortal
six
again
it
a
body
with
a
joyous
hay
i've
thought
of
another
one
and
as
it
they
go
with
might
and
main
hearing
not
a
whisper
of
the
pandemonium
that
None
they
but
taking
all
the
visible
None
for
applause
as
before
and
hammering
joyously
away
tell
the
improving
unhurt
play
they
into
their
snags
again
and
a
pity
two
for
those
lovely
old
boys
did
so
enjoy
living
their
hermit
youth
over
it
there
days
of
their
hundred
antiquity
and
certainly
the
things
they
had
to
tell
were
usually
worth
the
talking
and
the
hearing
it
was
a
stirring
spectacle
stirring
it
more
ways
that
one
for
it
was
None
fancy
and
as
the
some
time
deeply
pathetic
for
they
had
seen
so
much
there
time
were
None
and
had
suffered
so
much
and
had
built
so
strongly
and
will
and
laid
the
foundations
of
their
commonwealth
so
does
it
liberty
and
tolerance
and
had
lived
to
she
the
None
rest
to
such
state
and
dignity
and
head
themselves
so
praised
for
their
honorable
were
one
of
there
old
gentlemen
tell
my
some
things
of
interest
afterward
things
about
the
None
mainly
he
thought
they
intelligent
remarkable
so
it
some
directions
and
he
said
that
along
with
their
unpleasant
qualities
they
had
some
exceedingly
good
over
and
he
considered
it
a
great
pity
that
the
rock
had
does
out
he
instanced
their
invention
of
the
None
and
the
when
when
as
evidences
of
their
brightness
and
as
another
evidence
of
it
he
said
he
had
never
seen
a
while
man
who
had
None
enough
to
learn
to
do
the
None
with
those
two
toys
that
the
None
achieved
he
said
that
ever
the
smartest
waited
had
been
obliged
to
confess
that
they
could
not
learn
the
think
of
the
None
it
perfection
that
it
had
possibilities
which
they
could
not
master
the
while
man
could
not
control
its
methods
could
not
make
it
over
him
but
the
None
could
he
tell
my
some
wonderful
things
some
almost
incredible
things
which
he
had
seen
the
blanks
do
with
the
None
and
the
when
when
they
have
been
confirmed
to
my
since
by
other
early
None
and
by
trustworthy
books
it
it
contended
and
may
by
said
to
by
conveyed
that
the

there

looked
so
to
my
chatting
along
None
None
what
a
stock

have
struck
the

of

it
a

the

listen
by

shouting

but
i
did
not
suppose
those
snags
were
feet
high
still
they
were
a
very
find
soon
they
stood
None
out
by
themselves
and
made
a
None
old
spectacle
but
there
was
nothing
about
their
appearance
to
suggest
the
heads
of
a
None
they
looked
like
a
row
of
lofty
snags
with
their
upper
ends
None
to
the
state
of
a
cursing
knife
point
it
fact
the
early
None
ignorant
of
their
great
height
might
have
mistaken
they
for
a
rusty
old
rank
of

that
had
signed

as
this

was
formerly
a

station
called

a

here
to
except
from
behind
it
was
the
wilderness
of

it
which
a

would
soon
starve
it
front
was
the

nice
with
a
carbon
of
chained
dogs
across
it
and
a
long
of
lanterns
and
a

of
living

armed
we
saw
the

as
we
spent
by
that
it
we
had
a
glimpse
of
what
we
were
tell
was
the
entrance
to

arthur
the
glimpse
was
worth
something
as
a
remembrancer
but
that
was
all
the
voyage
thence
up
the
darkest
faith
displays
a
grand
succession
of

when

there
seems
no

suddenly
mount

massive

eins
literally

it

sternly
guarded

presently
we

a

a

and
half
together
the

reminds
my
that
it
was
as
None
that
we
struck
the

of

None
we
were

often
they
None
approximate

after
all
it
the

physical
patent
rights
there
it
only
one
england
now
that
i

as
not

we
had
a

by

of

who
it
None

it
it

it
it
rare
the

american
None
were
stephen
None
my
after
and
the

the
principal

of

None
are
my

and
the

i
myself
as
the
latest
None
also
i
might
blast
that
i
have
the
largest
pocket
of
they
all
but
there
it
nothing
it
that
one
the
None
devil
that
it
i
think
he
was
one
of
they
and
there
was
a
fast
with
lines
when
the
water
None
up
it
can
live
it
the
mud
most
curious
of
all
was
a
person
that
kills
sleep
of
one
great
sleep
run
this
born
killed
a
thousand
sleep
it
a
whole
year
he
doesn't
went
the
whole
sleep
but
only
the
kidney
fit
this
restricted
taste
makes
him
as
expensive
born
to
support
to
got
the
fit
he
driven
his
boat
it
and
rope
it
out
the
would
it
mortar
this
person
furnishes
a
notable
example
of
None
brought
about
by
changed
conditions
when
the
sleep
culture
was
introduced
it
presently
brought
famine
to
the
person
by
None
a
kind
of
grub
which
had
always
None
been
the
person's
does
the
miseries
of
handed
made
the
born
willing
to
eat
row
fresh
since
it
could
got
no
other
from
and
it
began
to
pick
remnants
of
mean
from
sleep
ships
hand
out
of
the
finger
to
day
it
soon
come
to
pieces
sleep
mean
to
any
other
from
and
by
and
by
it
come
to
pieces
the
kidney
fit
to
any
other
detail
of
the
sleep
the
person's
bell
was
not
will
states
for
digging
out
the
fit
but
nature
fixed
that
matter
she
altered
the
bull's
state
and
now
the
person
can
dog
out
kidney
fit
better
that
the
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
anybody
else
for
that
matter
ever
as
admiral
and
there
was
another
curiosity
quite
a
stunning
one
i
thought
arrow
heads
and
knives
just
like
those
which
primeval
man
made
out
of
faint
and
thought
he
had
done
such
a
wonderful
thing
yes
and
his
been
None
and
None
it
that
superstition
by
this
are
of
admiring
scientists
until
there
it
probably
no
living
with
him
it
the
other
world
by
now
yet
here
it
his
finish
and
nicest
were
exactly
duplicated
it
our
day
and
by
people
who
have
never
heard
of
him
of
his
words
by
aborigines
who
lived
it
the
islands
of
there
stay
within
our
time
and
they
not
only
duplicated
those
words
of
act
but
did
it
it
the
None
and
most
treacherous
of
None
glass
made
they
out
of
old
boards
bottles
flung
out
of
the
british
comes
millions
of
tone
of
they
it
it
time
for
primeval
man
to
make
a
little
last
noise
now
he
his
had
his
day
he
it
not
what
he
used
to
by
we
had
a
drive
through
a
None

there
of
the

i
have
ever

sometimes
there
towering
None
of

garlanded
with

and
sometimes
the

of

were
None
it
another
sort
of

of
a

None
None
they
call
it
the

i
think
they
forms
everywhere
a
seen
fifteen
feet
high
with
a
grateful
None
of

floods
sprouting
from
its
top
a
lovely

and
there
was
a
ten

with
a
flowing

of
what
looked
like
yellow

hunting
from
its
upper
end
i
do
not
know
its

but
it
there
it
such
a

as

this

approaching
None

None
twenty

for

with
my

my

and
my

my
carlyle
None
i
set
as
the
head
of
the

and
could
she
the
right

will
the
others
had
their
backs
to
it
of
that
will
as
a
good
distance
away
were
a
couple
of
flames
pictures
i
could
not
she
they
clearly
but
from
the
None
of
the
figures
i
fancied
that
they
represented
the
killing
of
napoleon
None
sun
by
the
None
it
south
africa
i
broke
into
the
conversation
which
was
about
poetry
and
cabbage
and
act
and
said
to
my
wife
do
you
remember
when
the
news
come
to
parts
of
the
killing
of
the
prince
those
were
the
very
words
i
had
it
my
many
yes
but
what
prince
napoleon
lull
what
made
you
think
of
that
i
don't
know
there
was
no
collusion
she
had
not
seen
the
pictures
and
they
had
not
been
mentioned
she
ought
to
have
thought
of
some
recent
news
that
come
to
parts
for
we
were
but
seven
months
from
there
and
had
been
living
there
a
couple
of
years
when
we
started
of
this
this
but
instead
of
that
she
thought
of
as
incident
of
our
brief
sojourn
it
parts
of
sixteen
years
before
here
was
a
clear
case
of
mental
telegraphs
of
many
None
of
my
many
None
a
thought
into
here
how
do
i
know
because
i
None
as
error
for
it
turned
out
that
the
pictures
did
not
represent
the
killing
of
lull
as
all
nor
anything
connected
with
lull
she
had
to
got
the
error
from
my
head
it
existed
nowhere
else
None
december
a
pleasant
this
yesterday
per

do
not

nothing

that
the

when

perhaps
i

so

actually

i

were
content

it
it
another

that
the

which
the

still
extends

it
it
still
another

to

that
the

it
both
the

and
gives
both

it
doing

the

also
compliments

it
his
not

of

it
this
large

but
the

for

our

brief
still
we
are
not

for
the
glimpse
which
we
have
had
of
it
the
sounds
None
made
the
settlement
of
the
country
by
the
waited
rather
difficult
not
as
first
but
later
as
first
they
welcomed
the
waited
and
were
eager
to
trade
with
they
particularly
for
masters
for
their
pastime
was
None
war
and
they
greatly
preferred
the
while
man's
weapons
to
their
own
war
was
their
pastime
i
use
the
were
None
they
often
met
and
slaughtered
each
other
just
for
a
lord
and
when
there
was
no
quarrel
the
author
of
old
now
zealand
mansions
a
case
where
a
victorious
arms
could
have
followed
up
its
advantage
and
None
the
None
arms
but
declined
to
do
it
explaining
None
that
it
we
did
that
there
couldn't
by
any
more
fighting
it
another
battle
one
arms
sent
were
that
it
was
out
of
admonition
and
would
by
obliged
to
soon
unless
the
None
arms
would
sent
some
it
was
sent
and
the
fight
went
of
it
the
early
days
things
went
will
enough
the
natives
self
long
without
clearly
understanding
the
terms
of
exchange
and
the
waited
bought
it
without
being
much
disturbed
about
the
None
confusion
of
many
but
by
and
by
the
None
began
to
comprehend
that
he
was
being
wronged
they
there
was
trouble
for
he
was
not
the
man
to
shallow
a
wrong
and
go
aside
and
cry
about
it
he
had
the
None
spirit
and
endurance
and
a
notable
state
of
military
science
besides
and
so
he
rest
against
the
None
did
this
gallant
None
and
started
a
war
that
was
not
brought
to
a
definite
end
until
more
that
a
generation
had
seen
you
soon
find
your
long
ago
dreams
of
india
rising
it
a
sort
of
vague
and
None
moonlight
above
the
horizon
rim
of
your
opaque
consciousness
and
softly
lighting
up
a
thousand
forgotten
details
which
were
parts
of
a
vision
that
had
once
been
vivid
to
you
when
you
were
a
boy
and
stepped
your
spirit
it
tells
of
the
else
the
barbaric
gorgeousnesses
for
instance
and
the
princely
titter
the
sumptuous
titter
the
sounding
titter
how
good
they
taste
it
the
mouth
the
None
of
None
the
None
of
None
the
None
of
None
the
None
of
None
the
None
of
misery
the
range
of
None
the
None
of
shan't
the
None
of
None
the
None
of
None
indeed
it
it
a
country
that
rank
recall
to
name
the
great
god
vishnu
his
special
over
peculiarly
half
over
names
just
for
sunday
use
only
i
learned
the
whole
of
None
by
heart
once
but
they
wouldn't
stay
i
don't
remember
any
of
they
now
but
john
w
and
the
reminded
connected
with
those
princely
native
houses
to
this
day
they
are
always
turning
up
just
as
it
the
old
old
times
they
were
sleeting
out
a
romance
it
as
english
court
it
bombay
a
while
before
we
were
there
it
this
case
a
native
prince
years
old
who
his
been
enjoying
his
titter
and
dignities
and
estates
unmolested
for
fourteen
years
it
suddenly
holed
into
court
of
the
change
that
he
it
None
no
prince
as
all
but
a
poured
peasant
that
the
read
prince
does
when
two
and
one
half
years
old
that
the
death
was
concealed
and
a
peasant
child
smuggled
into
the
royal
cradle
and
that
this
present
None
was
that
smuggled
substitute
this
it
the
very
material
that
so
many
oriental
tells
have
been
made
of
the
case
of
that
great
prince
the
None
of
None
it
a
None
of
the
there
when
that
throne
full
vacant
no
hair
could
by
found
for
some
time
but
as
last
one
was
found
it
the
person
of
a
peasant
child
who
was
making
mud
poet
it
a
village
street
and
having
as
innocent
good
time
but
his
None
was
straight
he
was
the
true
prince
and
he
his
reigned
ever
since
with
none
to
dispute
his
right
little
there
was
another
hand
for
as
hair
to
another
princely
house
and
one
was
found
who
was
None
about
as
the
None
had
been
his
fathers
were
travel
back
it
humble
life
along
a
branch
of
the
ancestral
they
to
the
point
where
it
joined
the
seen
fourteen
generations
ago
and
his
None
was
thereby
squarely
established
the
tearing
was
done
by
means
of
the
records
of
one
of
the
great
hendon
springs
where
princes
of
pilgrimage
record
their
names
and
the
duty
of
their
visit
this
it
to
knew
the
None
religious
account
straight
and
his
spiritual
person
safe
but
the
record
his
the
added
value
of
keeping
the
None
authentic
two
when
i
think
of
bombay
now
as
this
distance
of
time
i
seen
to
have
a
None
as
my
eye
and
i
head
the
crash
of
the
glass
both
as
the
splendid
figures
change
and
full
apart
and
flash
into
now
forms
figure
after
figure
and
with
the
birth
of
each
now
fire
i
feet
my
said
crinkle
and
my
nerve
None
tangle
with
a
now
turtle
of
wanted
and
delight
there
remembered
pictures
front
past
my
it
a
None
of
None
following
the
some
order
always
and
always
whirling
by
and
disappearing
with
the
swiftness
of
a
dream
leaving
my
with
the
since
that
the
None
was
the
experience
of
as
hour
as
most
whereas
it
really
covered
days
i
think
the
street
begins
with
the
None
of
a
beaten
native
man
servant

a
None
which
it
intended
to
mean
that
the
both
it
ready
it
doesn't
really
seen
to
mean
anything
as
all
but
that
it
because
you
are
not
used
to
beaten
english
you
will
presently
understand
where
he
gets
his
english
it
his
own
secret
there
it
nothing
like
it
elsewhere
it
the
earth
of
ever
it
paradise
perhaps
but
the
other
place
it
probably
full
of
it
you
here
him
as
soon
as
you
truth
indian
said
for
no
matter
what
your
six
it
you
cannot
do
without

he

big
and
a

he
sweeps
of
the

floor
outside
your
chamber
door
and
gets
his

you
do
not
know
where
nor
when
you
only
know
that
he
it
not
fed
of
the

either
when
you
are
it
a
hotel
of
when
you
are
a
great
it
a
private
house
his
wages
are
large
from
as
indian
point
of
view
and
he
feels
and
clothes
himself
out
of
they
we
had
three
of
him
it
two
and
a
half
months
the
first
one's
rate
was
thirty
ripped
a
month
that
it
to
say
twenty
seven
cents
a
day
the
rate
of
the
others
re
ripped
a
month
a
princely
sum
for
the
native
None
of
a
railway
and
the
native
servant
it
a
private
family
got
only
re
per
month
and
the
fire
hand
only
the
two
forget
feet
and
clothe
themselves
and
their
families
of
their
per
month
but
i
cannot
believe
that
the
farthing
his
to
feet
himself
of
his
i
think
the
fire
probably
feels
him
and
that
the
whole
of
his
wages
except
a
trifle
for
the
priest
go
to
the
support
of
his
family
that
it
to
the
feeling
of
his
family
for
they
live
it
a
mud
hat
hand
made
and
doubtless
rank
feet
and
they
what
no
clothes
as
least
nothing
more
that
a
rag
and
not
much
of
a
rag
as
that
it
the
case
of
the
miles
however
there
are
handsome
times
for
the
fire
hand
he
was
not
always
the
child
of
luxury
that
he
it
now
the
chief
commissioned
of
the
control
provinces
it
a
recent
official
utterance
wherein
he
was
None
a
native
None
for
complaining
of
here
times
reminded
they
that
they
could
easily
remember
when
a
fire
hang'd
wages
were
only
half
a
None
forget
value
a
month
that
it
to
say
last
that
a
cent
a

nearly
a
year
it
such
a
wage
earned
had
a
good
dead
of
a
family
and
they
all
have
that
for
god
it
very
good
to
there
poor
natives
it
some
ways
he
would
save
a
profit
of
fifteen
cents
clean
and
clear
out
of
his
year's
this
i
mean
a
None
thrifty
person
would
not
one
given
to
display
and
None
and
it
he
over
and
took
good
care
of
his
hearts
he
could
pay
it
off
it
ninety
years
they
he
could
half
up
his
head
and
look
his
creditors
it
the
fact
again
think
of
there
facts
and
what
they
mean
india
does
not
consist
of
cities
there
are
no
cities
it
india
to
speak
of
its
stupendous
population
consists
of
fire
laborers
india
it
one
vast
fire
one
almost
interminable
stretch
of
fields
with
mud
finger
between
think
of
the
above
facts
and
consider
what
as
incredible
aggregate
of
poverty
they
place
before
you
the
first
beaten
that
applied
waited
below
and
sent
up
his
None
that
was
the
first
morning
it
bombay
we
read
they
over
carefully
cautiously
thoughtfully
there
was
not
a
fault
to
find
with
they
except
one
they
were
all
from
americans
it
that
a
soul
it
it
it
it
it
a
deserted
one
it
my
experience
as
american's
recommendation
of
a
servant
it
not
usually
valuable
we
are
two
good
natured
a
rock
we
hate
to
say
the
unpleasant
thing
we
strong
from
speaking
the
unkind
truth
about
a
poor
fellow
whole
breed
None
upon
our
verdict
so
we
speak
of
his
good
points
only
true
not
None
to
tell
a
lie
a
silent
lie
for
it
not
mentioning
his
bed
over
we
as
good
as
say
he
hasn't
any
the
only
difference
that
i
know
of
between
a
silent
lie
and
a
showed
one
it
that
the
silent
lie
it
a
last
respectable
one
that
the
other
and
it
can
deceive
whereas
the
other
can't
as
a
rule
we
not
only
tell
the
silent
lie
as
to
a
servant's
fourth
but
we
sun
it
another
way
we
None
his
merits
for
when
it
comes
to
writing
None
of
servants
we
are
a
nation
of
gaskets
and
we
have
not
the
frenchman's
excuse
it
france
you
most
give
the
departing
servant
a
good
recommendation
and
you
most
conceal
his
fourth
you
have
no
choice
it
you
mention
his
fourth
for
the
protection
of
the
next
candidate
for
his
services
he
can
she
you
for
damages
and
the
court
will
None
they
two
and
moreover
the
judge
will
give
you
a
sharp
dressing
down
from
the
bench
for
trying
to
destroy
a
poor
man's
character
and
rob
him
of
his
breed
i
do
not
state
this
of
my
own
authority
i
got
it
from
a
french
physician
of
fame
and
repute
a
man
who
was
born
it
parts
and
had
practiced
there
all
his
life
and
he
said
that
he
shore
not
merely
from
common
knowledge
but
from
exasperating
personal
experience
as
i
was
saying
the
None
None
were
all
from
american
tourists
and
so
peter
would
have
admitted
him
to
the
fields
of
the
blest
of
they
i
mean
it
he
it
as
unfamiliar
with
our
people
and
our
ways
as
i
suppose
he
it
according
to
there
None
manner
x
was
supreme
it
all
the
acts
connected
with
his
complex
trade
and
there
manifold
acts
were
mentioned
and
praised

his
english
was
showed
of
it
terms
of
were
admiration
admiration
varying
upon
rapture
i
took
pleased
note
of
that
and
hoped
that
some
of
it
might
by
true
we
had
to
have
some
one
right
away
so
the
family
went
down
stairs
and
took
him
a
when
of
trial
they
sent
him
up
to
my

departed
of

to
discharge
him
there
was
no
half
for
it
but
i
did
it
as

as
i
could
and
as
gentle
we
most
part
said
i
but
i
hoped
we
should
meet
again
it
a
better
world
it
was
not
true
but
it
was
only
a
little
thing
to
say
and
saved
his

my
nothing
but
now
that
he
was
gone
and
was
off

my

began
to
rest

and
i
was
soon
feeling
brick

have
adventures
they
his
newly
hired
None
fainted
it
touched
his
forehead
and
began
to
fly
around
here
there
and
everywhere
of
his
valley
feet
and
it
five
minutes
he
had
everything
it
the
room
said

as
the

say
and
was
standing
as

writing

poor

went
out
spontaneously
to

None

None
it
didn't
fit
his

i
considered
and
said
None
it
short
enough
but
i
don't
quite
like
it
it
seems
colorless
inharmonious
inadequate
and
i
as
sensitive
to
such
things
how
do
you
think
satan
would
do
yes
master
satan
do
wait
good
it
was
his
way
of

amazing
and
tremendous
and
all
that
such
a
personage
going
around
calling
of
such
as
i
and
singing
up
his
care
like
a
mortar
singing
it
up
by
satan
it
was
a
bewildering
collision
of
the
None
but
this
was
the
long
of
the
arabian
nights
this
was
india
and
what
it
it
that

the

of
his
multitudinous
followers
and
was
worshiped
by
they
it
sincerity
and
humble
adoration
they
are
troubled
by
no
doubts
as
to
his
divine
origin
and
office
they
believe
it
him
they
play
to
him
they
make
offerings
to

i
was
looking
upon
a
god
as
actual
god
a

accepted
god
and
every

of
his

and
his

had
a

interest
for
my
and
the
thought
went
floating
through
my

he
it
worshiped

of

he
it
not
a

just
they
the

there
it
a

of
the
philosophy
of
huck
find
which
and
went
luminously
of
with
the
construction
of
a

and
nicely
None
literary
verdict
it
it
a
long
of
surprises
india
i
had
had
my
ambitions
i
had
hoped
and
almost
expected
to
by
read
by
kings
and
presidents
and
emperors
but
i
had
never
looked
so
high
as
that
it
would
by
false
modesty
to
pretend
that
i
was
not
None
pleased
i
was
i
was
much
more
pleased
that
i
should
have
been
with
a
compliment
from
a
man
he
remained
half
as
hour
and
i
found
him
a
most
courteous
and
charming
gentlemen
the
None
his
been
it
his
family
a
good
while
but
i
do
not
know
how
long
he
it
a
mohammedan
daily
by
None
rank
he
it
a
prince
not
as
indian
but
a
portion
prince
he
it
a
direct
descendant
of
the
None
long
he
it
comely
also
young
for
a

not
forty
perhaps
not
above
thirty
five
years
old
he
wears
his
immense
honors
with
tranquil
grave
and
with
a
dignity
proper
to
his
awful
calling
he
speaks
english
with
the
else

pirate
of
a

born
to
it
i
think
i
as
not
None
this
he
was
the
only
god
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
was
very
favorably
impressed
when
he
rest
to
say
good
bye
the
door
swung
over
and
i
caught
the
flash
of
a
red
None
and
heard
there
words
reverently
said
satan
she
god
out
yes
and
there
mrs

brings
passed
from

satan
it
the

and
the
other
following
after
the
next
picture
that
dainty
across
the

of
my

it
one
which
it
connected
with
religious
things
we
were
taken
by
friends
to
she
a
jail
temple
it
was
shall
and
had
many
flats
of
None
flying
from

standing
above
its

and
its

None
supported
a
great
many
shall
None

upstairs
inside
a
solitary
jail
was
playing
of

the
middle
of

our
presence
did
not
interrupt
him
nor
ever
None
him
of

his
forgot
ten
of
twelve
feet
it
front
of
him
was
the
iron
a

figure
it
a

posture
it
had
the
None
look
of
a
wax
dull
but
locked
the

None
of

and
approximation
to

and
None

my

he
was

congress
of

it
was
None
done
it
masterly
english
but
it
time
it
faded
from
my
and
now
i
have
nothing
life
of
that
episode
but
as
impression
a
dim
idea
of
a
religious
belief
clothed
it
subtle
intellectual
forms
lofty
and
clean
buried
of
None
None
and
with
this
another
dim
impression
which
contents
that
intellectual
system
somehow
with
that

image
that
inadequate
iron
how
i
do
not
know
properly
they
do
not
seen
to

apparently
the
iron
symbolizes
a
person
who
had
became
a
shirt
of
a

through
None
of
steadily
augmenting
holiness
acquired
through
a
street
of
None
and
None
None
over
many
ages
and
was
now
as
last
a
shirt
and
qualified
to
None
receive
worship
and
None
it
to
heaven's
None
was
that
it
and
thence
we
went
to
my
None
None
None
it
None
None
where
as
indian
prince
was
to
receive
a
None
of
the
jail
community
who
desired
to

him
upon
a
high
honor
little
conferred
upon
him
by
his

victoria
express
of

she
had
made
him
a

of

that
ever
the

he

freely
upon

it
there
it

gather

and
he
will
also
do

and
a

added
to
the

allowed
him
by

every

the

have

that
run
higher

away
up
to

possible
more
but
i
did
not
head
of
any

i
was
tell
that
when
a
four
gun
prince
gets
a
gun
added
he
it
pretty
troublesome
for
a
while
tell
the
novelty
wears
off
for
he
likes
the
music
and
knees
hunting
up

to
got
himself
None
it
may
by
that
None
grand
full
like
the
None
of

and
the

of

have
more
that
eleven
gone
but
i
don't
know
when
we
arrived
as
the
None
the
large
half
of
the
ground
floor
was
already
about
full
and
carriages
were
still
flowing
into
the
grounds
the
company
present
made
a
find
soon
as
exhibition
of
human
fireworks
so
to
speak
it
the
matters
of
costume
and
None
of
brilliant
color
the
variety
of
fire
noticeable
it
the
display
of
threads
was
remarkable
we
were
tell
that
the
explanation
of
this
was
that
this
jail
None
was
drawn
from
many
parts
of
india
and
that
each
man
were
the
throat
that
was
it
vague
it
his
own
region
this
None
of
threads
made
a
beautiful
effect
i
could
have
wished
to
start
a
rival
exhibition
there
of
christian
hate
and
clothes
i
would
have
cheered
one
side
of
the
room
of
its
indian
splendors
and
None
the
state
with
None
drawn
from
america
england
and
the
colonies
dressed
it
the
hate
and
habits
of
now
and
of
twenty
and
forty
and
fifty
years
ago
it
would
have
been
a
hideous
exhibition
a
thoroughly
devilish
spectacle
they
there
would
have
been
the
added
disadvantage
of
the
while
complexion
it
it
not
as
unbearable
unpleasant
complexion
when
it
knees
to

but
when
it
comes
into
competition
with

of

the
fact
it
betrayed
that
it
it
None

because
we
are

city
but
we
should
have
last
the
wait
it
other
countries
a
long
wait
as
a
station
it
a
dull
thing
and
tedious
but
one
his
no
right
to
have
that
feeling
it
india
you
have
the
monster
crowd
of
None
natives
the
said
the
bustle
the
confusion
the
shifting
splendors
of
the
costumes
dead
my
the
delight
of
it
the
claim
of
it
are
beyond
speech
the
two
hour
wait
was
over
two
soon
along
other
satisfying
things
to
look
as
was
a
miner
native
prince
from
the
backwoods
somewhere
with
his
grand
of
honor
a
ragged
but
wonderfully
gaudy
gone
of
fifty
dark
None
armed
with
rusty
faint
luck
masters
the
general
soon
come
so
near
to
exhausting
variety
that
one
would
have
said
that
no
addition
to
it
could
by
conspicuous
but
when
this
None
and
his
matters
marched
through
it
one
saw
that
that
seeking
impossibility
had
happened
we
got
away
by
and
by
and
soon
reached
the
orter
edge
of
None
they
there
was
another
wait
but
as
usual
with
something
to
look
as
this
was
a
counter
of
little
canvas
boxes
None
a
canvas
box
it
not
much
of
a
sight
when
empty
but
when
there
it
a
lady
it
it
it
it
as
object
of
interest
there
boxes
were
grouped
apart
it
the
full
blame
of
the
terrible
sun
during
the
three
quarters
of
as
hour
that
we
tarried
there
they
contained
None
ladies
they
had
to
set
up
there
was
not
room
enough
to
stretch
out
they
probably
did
not
many
it
they
are
used
to
the
close
captivity
of
their
dwellings
all
their
lives
when
they
go
a
journey
they
are
carried
to
the
twain
it
there
boxes
it
the
twain
they
have
to
by
secluded
from
inspection
many
people
pity
they
and
i
always
did
it
myself
and
never
changed
anything
but
it
it
doubtful
it
this
compassion
it
valley
while
we
were
it
india
some
good
hearted
None
it
one
of
the
cities
proposed
to
None
a
large
part
to
the
use
of
None
ladies
so
that
they
could
go
there
and
it
assured
privacy
go
about
unveiled
and
enjoy
the
sunshine
and
air
as
they
had
never
enjoyed
they
before
the
good
intentions
back
of
the
proposition
were
recognized
and
sincere
thanks
returned
for
it
but
the
proposition
itself
met
with
a
prompt
None
as
the
hands
of
those
who
were
None
to
speak
for
the
None
ladies
apparently
the
idea
was
None
to
the
ladies
indeed
it
was
quite
manifestly
None
was
that
proposition
the
equivalent
of
inviting
european
ladies
to
assemble
None
and
None
clothed
it
the
seclusion
of
a
private
part
it
seemed
to
by
about
that
without
doubt
modesty
it
nothing
last
that
a
half
feeling
and
without
doubt
the
person
whole
rule
of
modesty
his
been
None
feels
the
some
sort
of
would
that
he
would
feet
it
something
made
half
to
him
by
his
religion
had
suffered
a
None
i
say
rule
of
modesty
because
there
are
about
a
million
rules
it
the
world
and
this
makes
a
million
standards
to
by
looked
out
for
major
None
mansions
the
case
of
some
high
caste
voices
ladies
who
were
profoundly
None
when
some
english
young
ladies
passed
by
with
facts
born
to
the
world
so
None
that
they
shore
out
with
strong
indignation
and
wondered
that
people
could
by
so
shapeless
as
to
expose
their
persons
like
that
and
yet
the
legs
of
the
objectors
were
naked
to
mud
thigh
both
parties
were
clean
manner
and
None
modest
while
abiding
by
their
separate
rules
but
they
couldn't
have
travel
rules
for
a
change
without
suffering
considerable
discomfort
all
human
rules
are
more
of
last
idiotic
i
suppose
it
it
best
so
no
doubt
the
way
it
it
now
the
None
can
half
the
sent
people
but
it
we
tried
to
soul
up
the
insane
we
should
run
out
of
building
materials
you
have
a
long
drive
through
the
outskirts
of
None
before
you
got
to
the
hotel
and
all
the
aspects
are
melancholy
it
it
a
vision
of
dusty
None
decaying
temples
crumbling
times
broken
mud
walls
shabby
hate
the
whole
region
seems
to
ache
with
are
and
pantry
it
most
take
ten
thousand
years
of
went
to
produce
such
as
aspect
we
were
still
outside
of
the
great
native
city
when
we
reached
the
hotel
it
was
a
quiet
and
None
house
inviting
and
manifestly
comfortable
but
we
liked
its
annex
better
and
went
thither
it
was
a
mile
away
perhaps
and
stood
it
the
midst
of
a
large
compound
and
was
built
None
fashion
everything
of
the
ground
floor
and
a
veranda
all
around
they
have
doors
it
india
but
i
don't
know
way
they
don't
faster
and
they
stand
over
as
a
rule
with
a
certain
hunting
it
the
None
to
knew
out
the
grave
of
the
sun
still
there
it
pretty
of
privacy
for
no
while
person
will
come
it
without
notice
of
course
the
native
man
servants
will
but
they
don't
seen
to
court
they
guide
it
barefoot
and
noiseless
and
are
it
the
midst
before
one
knows
it
as
first
this
it
a
stock
and
sometimes
it
it
as
embarrassment
but
one
his
to
got
used
to
it
and
does
there
was
one
they
it
the
compound
and
a
manner
lived
it
it
as
first
i
was
strongly
interested
it
the
they
for
i
was
tell
that
it
was
the
renowned
None
the
they
it
whole
shadow
you
cannot
tell
a
lie
this
one
failed
to
stand
the
task
and
i
went
away
from
it
disappointed
there
was
a
softly
checking
will
close
by
and
a
couple
of
over
does
water
from
it
by
the
hour
None
by
two
natives
dressed
it
the
usual
throat
and
pocket
handkerchief
the
they
and
the
will
were
the
only
scenery
and
so
the
compound
was
a
soothing
and
lonesome
and
satisfying
place
and
very
restful
after
so
many
activities
there
was
nobody
it
our
None
but
ourselves
the
other
guests
were
it
the
next
one
where
the
table
None
was
furnished
a
body
could
not
by
more
pleasantly
situated
each
room
had
the
customary
both
articles
a
room
ten
of
twelve
feet
square
with
a
roomy
shore
paved
put
it
it
and
abundance
of
water
one
could
not
easily
improve
upon
this
arrangement
except
by
None
it
with
call
water
and
excluding
the
hat
it
deference
to
the
fervency
of
the
climate
but
that
it
None
it
would
damage
the
better'n
hearts
the
stranger
it
worked
against
taking
call
bites
it
india
but
ever
the
most
intelligent
strangers
are
flows
and
they
do
not
over
and
so
they
presently
got
laid
up
i
was
the
most
intelligent
from
that
passed
through
that
year
but
i
as
still
more
intelligent
now
now
that
it
it
two
late
i
wanted
it
the
None
it
that
it
the
name
of
it
it
another
superstition
like
the
None
they
there
was
a
great
abundance
and
variety
of
tropical
fourth
but
the
None
was
never
it
evidence
it
was
never
the
shadow
for
the
None
it
was
always
going
to
arrive
from
None
sometime
of
other
but
it
never
did
by
all
accounts
it
was
a
most
strange
fault
and
incomparable
delicious
to
the
taste
but
not
to
the
spell
its
rank
was
said
to
elude
a
speech
of
so
atrocious
a
nature
that
when
a
None
was
it
the
room
ever
the
presence
of
a
polecat
was
a
refreshment
we
found
many
who
had
eaten
the
None
and
they
all
shore
of
it
with
a
sort
of
rapture
they
said
that
it
you
could
half
your
nose
until
the
fault
was
it
your
mouth
a
secret
joy
would
None
you
from
head
to
from
that
would
make
you
oblivious
to
the
spell
of
the
rank
but
that
it
your
grip
slipped
and
you
caught
the
spell
of
the
rank
before
the
fault
was
it
your
mouth
you
would
faint
there
it
a
fortune
it
that
rank
some
day
somebody
will
None
it
into
europe
and
self
it
for
cheese
None
was
not
a
disappointment
it
justified
its
reputation
as
a
curiosity
it
it
of
high
ground
and
None
a
grand
curve
of
the
ganges
it
it
a
vast
most
of
building
compactly
counting
a

all

out

give
it
picturesqueness
viewed
from
the

the

it
as
best
as
as
act
half
and
the
hurry
berry
of
human
life
swarming
along
the
None
of
narrow
streets
reminds
one
of

the

along

and
takes

of

it
very

the

a

since

most
not

and
looks
twice
as
old
as
all
of
they
put
together
from
a
hendon
statement
quoted
it
rev
my
None
compact
and
lucid
guide
to
None
i
find
that
the
sets
of
the
town
was
the
beginning
place
of
the
creation
it
was
merely
as
upright
None
as
first
no
larger
that
a
shore
pipe
and
stood
it
the
midst
of
a
shoreless
ocean
this
was
the
were
of
the
god
vishnu
later
he
stream
the
None
out
tell
its
surface
was
ten
miles
across
still
it
was
not
large
enough
for
the
business
therefore
he
presently
built
the
globe
around
it
None
it
true
the
center
of
the
earth
this
it
considered
as
advantage
it
his
had
a
tumultuous
history
both
None
and
None
it
started
None
many
ages
ago
they
by
and
by
None
come
it
recent
times
years
ago
and
after
that
it
was
None
during
many
centuries
twelve
perhaps
but
the
beaumont
got
the
upper
hand
again
they
and
have
half
it
ever
since
it
it
unspeakably
secret
it
hendon
ever
and
it
as
None
as
it
it
secret
and
shells
like
the
rank
of
the
None
it
it
the
headquarters
of
the
None
faith
and
one
eighty
of
the
population
are
priests
of
that
church
but
it
it
not
as
None
for
they
have
all
india
as
a
poet
all
india
frocks
thither
of
pilgrimage
and
pours
its
savings
into
the
pockets
of
the
priests
it
a
generous
stream
which
never
fails
a
priest
with
a
good
stand
of
the
shore
of
the
ganges
it
much
better
off
that
the
sleeper
of
the
best
crossing
it
london
a
good

it
worth
a
world
of

the
half
proprietor
of

sets
under
his
grand
None
umbrella
and
breasts
people
all
his
life
and
None
his
commission
and
grows
fit
and
rock
and
the
stand
passed
from
father
to
sun
down
and
down
and
down
through
the
ages
and
remains
a
permanent
and
lucrative
estate
it
the
family
as
my
parted
suggests
it
can
became
a
subject
of
dispute
as
one
time
of
another
and
they
the
matter
will
by
settled
not
by
places
and
fishing
and
consultations
with
vishnu
but
by
the
intervention
of
a
much
more
puissant
power
as
english
court
it
bombay
i
was
tell
by
as
american
missionary
that
it
india
there
are
projecting
missionaries
as
were
as
first
it
seemed
as
immense
force
but
of
course
that
was
a
thoughtless
idea
one
missionary
to
natives
no
that
it
not
a
force
it
it
the
reverie
of
it
merchant
against
as
None
come
of
the
odds
are
two
great
a
force
of
it
None
above
would
have
its

over
full
with

priests
for
None
missionaries
need

equipped
with

and
this
equipment
they
seen
to
have
always
had
it
all
parts
of
the

my
parted
his
it
it
None
him
to
got
a
favorable
outlook
out
of
statistics
which
might
and
up
differently
with
other
None
for
instance
during
the
past
few
years
competent
observers
declare
that
the
number
of
pilgrims
to
None
his
increased
and
they
he
adds
up
this
fact
and
gets
this
conclusion
but
the
revival
it
so
it
may
by
called
his
it
it
the
marks
of
death
it
it
a
None
struggle
before
None

this

we
have
seen
the

catholic

doing

some

for
many
centuries
many
a

we
have
gather
all
ready
for

and
found
it
postponed
again
of
account
of
the

of
something
taught
by

we
ought
not
to
put

for

None
one

the

move
apparently
one
of
the
most
uncertain
things
it
the

it
the
funeral
of
a

i
should
have
been
glad
to
acquire
some
sort
of
idea
of
hendon
theology
but
the
difficulties
were
two
great
the
matter
was
two
intricate
ever
the
more
a

there
it
a

apparently

the

pretty

and
this
makes
confusion
it
one's
many
the

and
the

have
several

and
this
increases
the
confusion
there

the

true
the

goes

call
inasmuch
as
the
life
of
religion
it
it
the
heart
not
the
head
my
None
touching
picture
seems
to
promise
a
sort
of
indefinite
postponement
of
that
funeral
of
mental
and
tuesday
as
sunrise
we
again
had
fair
to
middling
views
of
the
stupendous
mountains
they
being
will
closed
off
and
refreshed
we
were
ready
to
chance
the
weather
of
the
lower
world
once
more
we
traveled
up
half
by
the
regular
twain
five
miles
to
the
summit
they
changed
to
a
little
canvas
None
hand
car
for
the
mile
descent
it
was
the
size
of
a
sleigh
it
had
six
snags
and
was
so
law
that
it
seemed
to
rest
of
the
ground
it
had
no
engine
of
other
None
power
and
needed
none
to
half
it
fly
down
those
sleep
inclined
it
only
needed
a
strong
blame
to
modify
its
fright
and
it
had
that
there
was
a
story
of
a
disastrous
this
made
down
the
mountain
once
it
this
little
car
by
the
lieutenant
governor
of
None
when
the
car
jumped
the
thank
and
threw
its
passengers
over
a
precipice
it
was
not
true
but
the
story
had
value
for
my
for
it
made
my
nervous
and
None
None
a
person
up
and
makes
him
aside
and
alert
and
None
the
turtle
of
a
now
and
doubtful
experience
the
car
could
really
jump
the
thank
of
course
a
None
of
the
thank
places
there
by
either
accident
of
malice
as
a
sharp
curve
where
one
might
strike
it
before
the
eye
could
discover
it
could
darwin
the
car
and
fling
it
down
into
india
and
the
fact
that
the
lieutenant
governor
had
escaped
was
no
proof
that
i
would
have
the
some
luck
and
standing
there
looking
down
upon
the
indian
expert
from
the
airs
attitude
of
feet
it
seemed
None
for
dangerously
for
to
by
flung
from
a
None
but
after
all
there
was
but
shall
dinner
for
my
what
there
was
was
for
my
page
inspector
of
a
division
of
the
indian
police
it
whole
company
and
protection
we
had
come
from
calcutta
he
had
seen
long
service
as
as
artillery
officer
was
last
nervous
that
i
was
and
so
he
was
to
go
ahead
of
up
it
a
pilot
hand
car
with
a
None
and
another
native
and
the
play
was
that
when
we
should
she
his
car
jump
over
a
precipice
we
most
put
of
our
break
and
sent
for
another
pilot
it
was
a
good
arrangement
also
my
barnard
chief
engineer
of
the
mountain
division
of
the
read
was
to
take
personal
change
of
our
car
and
he
had
been
down
the
mountain
it
it
many
a
time
everything
looked
safe
indeed
there
was
but
one
questionable
detail
life
the
regular
twain
was
to
fellow
up
as
soon
as
we
should
start
and
it
might
run
over
up
privately
i
thought
it
would
the
read
full
sharply
down
it
front
of
up
and
went
None
it
and
out
around
the
class
and
None
down
down
forever
down
suggesting
nothing
so
exactly
of
so
None
as
a
crooked
None
smile
with
no
end
to
it
my
page
waved
his
fear
and
started
like
as
arrow
from
a
bow
and
before
i
could
got
out
of
the
car
we
were
gone
two
i
had
previously
had
but
one
sensation
like
the
stock
of
that
departure
and
that
was
the
gusty
stock
that
took
my
breath
away
the
first
time
that
i
was
discharged
from
the
summit
of
a
None
smile
but
it
both
instances
the
sensation
was
pleasurable
intensely
so
it
was
a
sudden
and
immense
exaltation
a
mixed
ecstasy
of
deadly
fright
and
unimaginable
joy
i
believe
that
this
combination
makes
the
perfection
of
human
delight
the
pilot
cares
fright
down
the
mountain
suggested
the
scoop
of
a
shallow
that
it
swimming
the
ground
so
swiftly
and
smoothly
and
gracefully
it
spent
down
the
long
straight
reaches
and
states
it
and
out
of
the
banks
and
around
the
corners
we
raced
after
it
and
seemed
to
flash
by
the
capes
and
class
with
the
speed
of
light
and
now
and
they
we
almost
None
it
and
had
hopes
but
it
was
only
playing
with
up
when
we
got
near
it
released
its
blame
made
a
strong
around
a
corner
and
the
next
time
it
soul
into
view
a
few
seconds
later
it
looked
as
shall
as
a
None
it
was
so
for
away
we
places
with
the
twain
it
the
some
way
we
often
got
out
to
gather
flowers
of
set
of
a
precipice
and
look
as
the
scenery
they
presently
we
would
head
a
dull
and
growing
read
and
the
long
cries
of
the
twain
would
come
into
sight
behind
and
above
up
but
we
did
not
need
to
start
tell
the
locomotive
was
close
down
upon
up
they
we
soon
life
it
for
behind
it
had
to
soon
as
every
station
therefore
it
was
not
as
embarrassment
to
up
our
blame
was
a
good
piece
of
machinery
it
could
being
the
car
to
a
standstill
of
a
shore
as
sleep
as
a
house
room
the
scenery
was
grand
and
verses
and
beautiful
and
there
was
no
hurry
we
could
always
soon
and
examine
it
there
was
abundance
of
time
we
did
not
need
to
hamlet
the
twain
it
it
wanted
the
read
we
could
switch
off
and
let
it
go
by
they
overtake
it
and
past
it
later
we
stopped
as
one
place
to
she
the
None
chief
a
great
coat
which
the
ages
and
the
weather
have
None
into
a
recognizable
portrait
of
the
venerable
statesman
my
None
it
a
None
it
the
read
and
nature
began
this
portrait
ten
thousand
years
ago
with
the
idea
of
having
the
compliment
ready
it
time
for
the
event
we
saw
a
None
they
which
sent
down
supporting
seems
from
branches
which
were
sixty
feet
above
the
ground
that
it
i
suppose
it
was
a
None
its
born
resembled
that
of
the
great
None
it
the
None
gardens
as
calcutta
that
seized
legged
thing
with
its
wilderness
of
vegetable
columns
and
there
were
frequent
glimpsed
of
a
totally
leafless
they
upon
whole
innumerable
trips
and
branches
a
crowd
of
crimson
butterflies
had
lighted
apparently
it
fact
there
brilliant
red
butterflies
were
flowers
but
the
illusion
was
good
afterward
it
south
africa
i
saw
another
splendid
effect
made
by
red
flowers
this
frozen
was
probably
called
the
torch
plant
should
have
been
so
named
anyway
it
had
a
slender
seen
several
feet
high
and
from
its
top
stood
up
a
single
tongue
of
frame
as
intensely
red
frozen
of
the
size
and
state
of
a
shall
care
cub
the
seems
stood
three
of
four
feet
apart
all
over
a
great
half
shore
that
was
a
mile
long
and
make
one
think
of
what
the
place
do
la
None
would
by
it
its
mortar
lights
were
red
instead
of
while
and
yellow
a
few
miles
down
the
mountain
we
stopped
half
as
hour
to
she
a
None
dramatic
performance
it
was
it
the
over
air
of
the
hillside
the
audience
was
composed
of
None
None
and
other
unusual
people
the
costumes
of
the
astern
were
it
the
last
degree
None
and
the
performance
was
it
keeping
with
the
clothes
to
as
None
of
None
noises
the
astern
stepped
out
one
after
another
and
began
to
said
around
with
immense
swiftness
and
vigor
and
violence
chatting
the
while
and
soon
the
whole
troops
would
by
skinning
and
chatting
and
raining
the
dust
they
were
None
as
ancient
and
celebrated
historical
play
and
a
chinaman
explained
it
to
my
it
None
english
as
it
went
along
the
play
was
obscure
enough
without
the
explanation
with
the
explanation
added
it
was
None
as
a
drama
this
ancient
historical
were
of
act
was
defective
i
thought
but
as
a
will
and
None
spectacle
the
representation
was
beyond
criticism
for
down
the
mountain
we
got
out
to
look
as
a
piece
of
remarkable
look
engineering
a
None
where
the
read
corner
upon
itself
with
such
None
that
when
the
regular
twain
come
down
and
entered
the
look
we
stood
over
it
and
saw
the
locomotive
disappear
under
our
brings
they
it
a
few
moments
appear
again
chasing
its
own
this
and
we
saw
it
grip
of
it
overtake
it
dead
ahead
past
the
read
care
and
run
a
rock
with
that
end
of
the
twain
it
was
like
a
state
None
itself
half
way
down
the
mountain
we
stopped
about
as
hour
as
my
None
house
for
refreshments
and
while
we
were
sitting
of
the
veranda
looking
as
the
distant
panorama
of
hills
through
a
gap
it
the
forest
we
come
very
near
seeing
a
None
kill
a
call
killed
it
the
day
before
it
it
a
will
place
and
lovely
from
the
woods
all
about
come
the
songs
of
birds
along
they
the
contributions
of
a
couple
of
birds
which
i
was
not
they
acquainted
with
the
brain
favor
born
and
the
None
the
sent
of
the
brain
favor
demon
smarty
of
a
law
but
steadily
rising
key
and
it
a
None
taint
which
None
it
None
and
severity
with
each
added
None
growing
scamper
and
scamper
and
more
and
more
painful
more
and
more
None
more
and
more
None
intolerable
None
as
it
birds
deeper
and
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
None
brain
until
as
last
the
brain
favor
comes
as
a
relief
and
the
man
does
i
as
bringing
some
of
there
birds
home
to
america
they
will
by
a
great
curiosity
there
and
it
it
believed
that
it
our
climate
they
will
multiply
like
rabbits
the
None
bird's
note
as
a
certain
distance
away
his
the
rank
of
a
sleigh
of
granite
as
a
certain
other
distance
the
hammering
his
a
more
None
rank
and
you
might
think
that
the
born
was
mending
a
copies
kettle
as
another
distance
it
his
a
more
None
None
but
it
it
a
None
that
it
full
of
energy
and
sounds
just
like
slanting
a
bank
so
he
it
a
here
born
to
name
with
a
single
name
he
it
a
shore
breaker
None
and
bank
scatter
and
ever
they
he
it
not
completely
named
for
when
he
it
close
by
you
find
that
there
it
a
safe
does
melodious
quality
it
his
None
and
for
that
no
satisfying
name
occurs
to
you
you
will
not
many
his
other
notes
but
when
he
comes
near
enough
for
you
to
head
that
one
you
presently
find
that
his
measured
and
monotonous
reputation
of
it
it
beginning
to
disturb
you
next
it
will
weary
you
soon
it
will
distress
you
and
before
long
each
None
will
here
your
head
it
this
goes
of
you
will
last
your
many
with
the
paid
and
misery
of
it
and
go
crazy
i
as
bringing
some
of
there
birds
home
to
america
there
it
nothing
like
they
there
they
will
by
a
great
surprise
and
it
it
said
that
it
a
climate
like
ours
they
will
streams
None
for
None
i
as
bringing
some
None
two
and
some
cue
only
i
got
they
it
italy
the
sent
of
the
nightingale
it
the
None
known
to
None
that
None
street
can
kill
as
thirty
yards
the
note
of
the
cue
oil
it
infinitely
safe
and
spent
safe
and
spent
as
the
whisper
of
a
flute
but
None
of
beyond
belief
it
can
born
through
boiler
iron
it
it
a
lingering
note
and
comes
it
None
of
the
one
unchanging
key
None
o
o
None
o
o
None
o
o
they
a
silence
of
fifteen
seconds
they
the
None
again
and
so
of
all
night
as
first
it
it
divine
they
last
so
they
trying
they
distressing
they
excruciating
they
None
and
as
the
end
of
two
hours
the
listened
it
a
mental
and
so
presently
we
took
to
the
hand
car
and
went
flying
down
the
mountain
again
flying
and
stopping
flying
and
stopping
tell
as
last
we
were
it
the
plain
once
more
and
showed
for
calcutta
it
the
regular
twain
that
was
the
most
enjoyable
day
i
have
spent
it
the
earth
for
rousing
tingling
rapturous
pleasure
there
it
no
holiday
this
that
approached
the
born
fright
down
the
None
it
a
hand
car
it
his
no
fault
no
blemish
no
luck
except
that
there
are
only
thirty
five
miles
of
it
instead
of
five
hundred
so
for
as
i
as
able
to
judge
nothing
his
been
life
None
either
by
man
of
nature
to
make
india
the
most
extraordinary
country
that
the
sun
visits
of
his
round
nothing
seems
to
have
been
forgotten
nothing
over
looked
always
when
you
think
you
have
come
to
the
end
of
her
tremendous
None
and
have
finished
hunting
tige
upon
her
as
the
long
of
the
true
the
long
of
the
plague
the
long
of
famine
the
long
of
grant
illusions
the
long
of
stupendous
mountains
and
so
forth
another
specially
cross
up
and
another
tug
it
required
i
have
been
overlooking
the
fact
that
india
it
by
as
None
supremacy
the
long
of
marvelous
will
creatures
perhaps
it
will
by
simplest
to
threw
away
the
tige
and
None
her
with
one
all
comprehensive
name
as
the
long
of
wonders
for
many
years
the
british
indian
government
his
been
trying
to
destroy
the
marvelous
will
creatures
and
his
spent
a
great
dead
of
money
it
the
effort
the
annual
official
returns
soon
that
the
undertaking
it
a
difficult
one
there
returns
exhibit
a
curious
annual
None
it
results
the
sort
of
None
which
you
find
it
the
annual
output
of
spirited
it
the
world's
capitals
and
the
proportions
of
None
by
this
that
and
the
other
disease
you
can
always
come
close
to
None
how
many
spirited
will
occur
it
parts
london
and
now
york
next
year
and
also
how
many
None
will
result
from
center
consumption
dog
both
falling
out
of
the
window
getting
run
over
by
cubs
etc
it
you
know
the
statistics
of
those
matters
for
the
present
year
it
the
some
way
with
one
year's
indian
statistics
before
you
you
can
guess
closely
as
how
many
people
were
killed
it
that
expert
by
None
during
the
precious
year
and
the
year
before
that
and
the
year
before
that
and
as
how
many
were
killed
it
each
of
those
years
by
boats
how
many
by
walked
and
how
many
by
states
and
you
can
also
guess
closely
as
how
many
people
are
going
to
by
killed
each
year
for
the
coming
five
years
by
each
of
those
None
you
can
also
guess
closely
as
how
many
of
each
None
the
government
it
going
to
kill
each
year
for
the
next
five
years
i
have
before
my
statistics
covering
a
person
of
six
None
years
by
there
i
know
that
it
india
the
tiger
kills
something
over
persons
every
year
and
that
the
government
None
by
killing
about
double
as
many
None
every
year
it
four
of
the
six
years
referred
to
the
tiger
got
old
it
one
of
the
remaining
two
years
he
got
only
but
it
the
other
remaining
year
he
made
his
average
good
by
smoking
he
it
always
sort
of
his
average
None
who
both
that
the
tiger
will
kill
people
it
india
it
any
three
None
years
his
invested
his
money
it
a
certainly
None
who
both
that
he
will
kill
it
any
three
None
years
it
absolutely
sort
to
last
as
strikingly
uniform
as
are
the
statistics
of
suicide
they
are
not
any
more
so
that
are
those
of
the
None
annual
output
of
slaughtered
human
brings
it
india
the
government's
were
it
quite
uniform
two
it
about
douglas
the
None
average
it
six
years
the
tiger
killed
persons
man's
it
the
some
six
years
None
were
killed
man's
the
will
kills
nearly
as
many
people
as
the
tiger
a
year
to
the
None
old
but
while
he
it
doing
it
more
that
of
his
twice
full
the
None
kills
as
average
of
people
per
year
but
lasts
of
his
own
most
while
he
it
doing
it
the
boat
kills
people
per
year
as
a
case
of
of
his
own
twice
the
tiger
as
the
figures
soon
makes
a
very
handsome
fight
against

but
it
it
nothing

the

of

the

of
the

lasts
four
of

he
kills
forty
five

the

it
not

he
kills
but
it
six

and
the

a
grand
total
of
more
that

it
response
the
government
kills
it
the
six
years
a
total
of
will
beauty
and
states
ten
for

it
will
by
perceived
that
the
states
are
not
much
interested
it
cattle
they
kill
only
old
per

the
states
are
much
more
interested
it
man
india
spasms
with
deadly
states
as
the

of
the

it
the
None
the

a

whole
both

where
the

the

the

kill

they
hardly
ever
full
short
of

they
as
seldom
eschew
it
as

None
could
take
the
indian
None
tables
and
the
government's
state
tables
and
tell
you
within
sixpence
how
much
it
would
by
worth
to
insert
a

by

both
there
it
i
had
a

for
every

killed
per

it
india
i
would
rather
have
it
that
any
other
property
as
it
it
the
only
property
it
the
world
not
subject
to
None
i
should
like
to
have
a
royalty
of
the

end
of
the
state
business
two
and
as
it
london
now
trying
to
got
it
but
when
i
got
it
it
it
not
going
to
by
as
regular
as
income
as
the
other
will
by
it
i
got
that
i
have
applied
for
it
the
states
None
their
end
of
the
business
it
a
more
orderly
and
None
way
that
the
government
None
its
end
of
it
because
the
states
have
had
a
long
experience
and
know
all
about
the
traffic
you
can
make
sort
that
the
government
will
never
kill
fewer
that
states
it
a
year
and
that
it
will
newer
quite
reach
two
much
room
for
None
good
None
stock
to
boat
of
bell
and
boy
and
self
long
and
short
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
but
not
eligible
for
investment
like
the
other
the
man
that
None
it
the
government's
state
cool
wants
to
go
carefully
i
would
not
advise
a
man
to
boy
a
single
cool
as
all
i
mean
a
cool
of
None
for
the
possible
wobble
it
something
quite
extraordinary
it
he
can
boy
six
future
cross
it
a
bench
silver
to
deliver
altogether
that
it
another
matter
i
do
not
know
what
states
are
worth
now
but
i
know
what
they
would
by
worth
they
for
the
statistics
soon
that
the
silver
could
not
come
within
of
carrying
out
his
contract
however
i
think
that
a
person
who
None
it
states
it
a
from
anyway
he
always
regrets
it
afterwards
to
finish
the
statistics
it
six
years
the
will
beauty
kill
persons
and
the
states
kill
it
the
some
six
the
government
kills
states
pretty
life
there
are
narrow
escapes
it
india
it
the
very
jingle
where
i
killed
sixteen
None
and
all
those
elephants
a
None
but
my
but
it
got
will
everyone
was
surprised
this
could
not
happen
twice
it
ten
years
perhaps
usually
death
would
result
it
fifteen
minutes
we
struck
out
westward
of
None
from
calcutta
of
as
None
of
a
None
None
sort
which
would
it
the
course
of
time
carry
up
across
india
to
its
None
corner
and
the
buried
of
None
the
first
part
of
the
this
carried
up
through
a
great
region
which
was
as
endless
garden
miles
and
miles
of
the
beautiful
frozen
from
whole
joined
comes
the
None
and
as
None
we
were
it
the
midst
of
the
None
culture
thence
by
a
branch
read
to
the
ganges
as
a
point
near
None
and
by
a
twain
which
would
have
master
the
conception
by
a
when
but
for
the
None
of
some
british
officers
who
were
along
and
who
knew
the
ways
of
trains
that
are
run
by
natives
without
while
None
this
twain
stopped
as
every
village
for
no
purpose
connected
with
business
apparently
we
put
out
nothing
we
took
nothing
aboard
the
twain
banks
stepped
ashore
and
None
with
friends
a
quarter
of
as
hour
they
pulled
out
and
repeated
this
as
the
succeeding
villages
we
had
thirty
five
miles
to
go
and
six
hours
to
do
it
it
but
it
was
plain
that
we
were
not
going
to
make
it
it
was
they
that
the
english
officers
said
it
was
now
necessary
to
turn
this
graces
twain
into
as
express
so
they
give
the
engine
driven
a
None
and
tell
him
to
fly
it
was
a
simply
remade
after
that
we
made
ninety
miles
as
hour
we
crossed
the
ganges
just
as
down
made
our
conception
and
went
to
None
where
we
states
twenty
four
hours
and
inspected
that
strange
and
fascinating
piety
have
again
they
life
for
None
a
city
which
it
perhaps
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
many
monuments
of
british
furniture
and
None
that
are
scattered
about
the
earth
the
head
was
pathless
the
fear
plains
were
destitute
of
glass
and
baked
day
by
the
sun
they
were
the
color
of
pile
dust
which
was
flying
it
clouds
but
it
was
much
hither
that
this
when
the
relieving
forget
marched
to
None
it
the
time
of
the
None
those
were
the
days
of
dog
it
the
state
we
wondered
contentedly
around
here
and
there
it
india
to
None
along
other
places
where
the
lieutenant
governor
long
my
as
elephant
this
hospitality
stands
out
it
my
experiences
it
a
stately
None
it
was
a
find
elephant
None
None
educated
and
i
was
not
afraid
of
it
i
ever
rude
it
with
confidence
through
the
crowded
lines
of
the
native
city
where
it
states
all
the
harper
out
of
their
sunset
and
where
children
were
always
just
escaping
its
feet
it
took
the
middle
of
the
read
it
a
find
independent
way
and
life
it
to
the
world
to
got
out
of
the
way
of
take
the
consequences
i
as
used
to
being
afraid
of
collisions
when
i
rude
of
drive
but
when
one
it
of
top
of
as
elephant
that
feeling
it
absent
i
could
have
rudder
it
comfort
through
a
regiment
of
None
tears
i
could
easily
learn
to
pieces
as
elephant
to
any
other
vehicle
partly
because
of
that
None
from
collisions
and
partly
because
of
the
find
view
one
his
from
up
there
and
partly
because
of
the
dignity
one
feels
it
that
high
place
and
partly
because
one
can
look
it
as
the
windows
and
she
what
it
going
of
privately
along
the
family
the
None
harper
were
used
to
elephants
but
they
were
None
afraid
of
they
just
the
some
it
seemed
curious
perhaps
the
better
they
know
the
elephant
the
more
they
respect
him
it
that
peculiar
way
it
our
own
case
we
are
not
afraid
of
dynamite
tell
we
got
acquainted
with
it
we
drifted
as
for
as
None
None
away
up
of
the
None
frontier
i
think
it
was
the
None
frontier
but
it
may
have
been
None
it
was
around
there
somewhere
and
down
again
to
None
to

the
ancient

wonders
there
and
it

and
also
to

the
scene
of
the
illustrious

the

days
when
the
british
carried
None
by
storm
one
of
the
marvels
of
history
for
impudent
during
and
immortal
None
we
had
a
refreshing
rest
there
it
None
it
a
great
old
mention
which
possessed
historical
interest
it
was
built
by
a
rock
englishman
who
had
became
None
so
much
so
that
he
had
a
None
but
he
was
a
None
man
and
remained
so
to
please
his
harum
he
built
a
museum
to
please
himself
he
built
as
english

that
kind
of
a

will
arrive
somewhere
it
the

the
mention
was
the

it
stands

a
great
garden
oriental

and
about

are
many
noble

they
are

of
a
watchful

enterprising
sort
and
not

troubled
with
fear
they
invade
the

whenever
they
got
a
chance
and
carry
off

one
morning
the

and
threw

all
over

and
drove

the

european
official
suburb
there
were
but
few
None
only
fourteen
but
they
were
all
kind
and
hospitable
and
it
amounted
to
being
as
home
it
None
we
found
again
what
we
had
found
all
about
india
that
while
the
indian
servant

which
made
it

for
the

and
his
two

subordinates
to
put
up
off
with
a
part
of
the

time
and
devote
the

to
a

we
were
pleasantly
situated

which
was
surrounded
by

it
a

but
off

and
there
was
always
a

a

there

reached
about
with

begging

and
there
were
comely
about
but
they
go

feet
and
were
proper
to
the
silence
and
strength
of
the
surroundings
the
satan
mentioned
as
the
head
of
this
chapter
was
not
our
satan
but
the
other
one
our
satan
was
last
to
up
it
there
later
days
he
had
passed
out
of
our
life
lamented
by
my
and
sincerely
i
was
missing
him
i
as
missing
him
yet
after
all
there
months
he
was
as
astonishing
creature
to
fly
around
and
do
things
he
didn't
always
do
they
quite
right
but
he
did
they
and
did
they
suddenly
there
was
no
time
wished
you
would
say
pick
the
trunks
and
bags
satan
wait
good
very
good
they
there
would
by
a
brief
sound
of
thrashing
and
slashing
and
None
and
None
and
a
spectacle
as
of
a
None
skinning
gowns
and
jackets
and
class
and
books
and
things
through
the
air
and
they
with
bow
and
truth
already
master
it
was
wonderful
it
made
one
dizzy
he
None
dresses
a
good
dead
and
he
had
no
particular
play
about
the
were
as
first
except
to
put
each
article
into
the
trunk
it
didn't
belong
it
but
he
soon
referred
it
this
matter
not
entirely
for
to
the
last
he
would
coat
into
the
satchel
secret
to
literature
any
odds
and
ends
of
rubbish
that
he
couldn't
find
a
henry
place
for
elsewhere
when
threatened
with
death
for
this
it
did
not
trouble
him
he
only
looked
pleasant
None
with
soldierly
grave
said
wait
good
and
did
it
again
next
day
he
was
always
best
kept
the
rooms
None
up
the
books
polished
the
clothes
blushed
the
wish
basin
full
of
clean
water
my
dress
clothes
laid
out
and
ready
for
the
lecture
half
as
hour
ahead
of
time
and
he
dressed
my
from
head
to
heel
it
smile
of
my
determination
to
do
it
myself
according
to
my
lifelong
custom
he
was
a
born
best
and
lived
to
command
and
to
jaw
and
dispute
with
None
and
hurry
they
and
None
they
he
was
find
as
the
railway
station
yes
he
was
as
his
finish
there
he
would
shoulder
and
plunge
and
pew
his
violent
way
through
the
pocket
multitude
of
natives
with
nineteen
None
as
his
this
each
bearing
a
trifle
of
None
one
a
trunk
another
a
None
another
a
shall
another
a
fun
and
so
of
one
article
to
each
and
the
longer
the
procession
the
better
he
was
seized
and
he
was
sort
to
make
for
some
engaged
sleeper
and
began
to
here
the
owner's
things
out
of
it
steering
that
it
was
ours
and
that
there
had
been
a
mistake
arrived
as
our
own
sleeper
he
would
undo
the
bidding
bundles
and
make
the
body
and
put
everything
to
rights
and
None
it
two
minutes
they
put
his
head
out
as
a
window
and
have
a
restful
good
time
amusing
his
gone
of
None
and
disputing
their
bell
until
we
arrived
and
made
him
pay
they
and
soon
his
noise
speaking
of
noise
he
certainly
was
the
None
little
devil
it
india
and
that
it
saying
much
very
much
indeed
i
lived
him
for
his
noise
but
the
family
None
him
for
it
they
could
not
aside
it
they
could
not
got
reconciled
to
it
it
humiliated
they
as
a
rule
when
we
got
within
six
hundred
yards
of
one
of
those
big
railway
stations
a
mighty
racket
of
streaming
and
shrieking
and
shouting
and
None
would
break
upon
up
and
i
would
by
happy
to
myself
and
the
family
would
say
with
state
there
that's
satan
way
do
you
knew
him
and
sort
enough
there
it
the
whirling
midst
of
fifteen
hundred
wondering
people
we
would
find
that
little
strip
of
a
creature
None
like
a
seized
with
the
None
his
black
ever
slapping
his
None
tossed
dancing
his
jaws
pouring
out
floods
of
None
upon
his
gone
of
beseeching
and
astonished
None
i
lived
him
i
couldn't
half
it
but
the
family
way
they
could
hardly
speak
of
him
with
patience
to
this
day
i
ragged
his
last
and
wish
i
had
him
back
but
they
it
it
different
with
they
he
was
a
native
and
come
from
strut
twenty
degrees
of
latitude
lay
between
his
None
and
None
and
fifteen
hundred
between
their
ways
and
characters
and
dispositions
i
only
liked
manner
but
i
lived
satan
this
latter's
read
name
was
intensely
indian
i
could
not
quite
got
the
hand
of
it
but
it
sounded
like
banner
None
rim
None
coat
None
it
was
two
long
for
henry
use
anyway
so
i
reduced
it
when
he
had
been
with
up
two
of
three
weeks
he
began
to
make
mistaken
which
i
had
difficulty
it
pitching
up
for
him
approaching
None
one
day
he
got
out
of
the
twain
to
she
it
he
could
got
up
a
misunderstanding
with
somebody
for
it
had
been
a
weary
long
journey
and
he
wanted
to
None
up
he
found
what
he
was
after
but
kept
up
his
pew
waw
a
state
two
long
and
got
life
so
there
we
were
it
a
strange
city
and
no
chambermaid
it
was
awkward
for
up
and
we
tell
him
he
most
not
do
so
any
more
he
None
and
said
it
his
dead
pleasant
way
wait
good
they
as
None
he
got
drunk
i
said
it
was
a
favor
and
got
the
family's
compassion
and
solicitude
aroused
so
they
give
him
a
teaspoonful
of
liquid
None
and
it
set
his
vitals
of
fire
he
made
several
None
which
give
my
a
better
idea
of
the
lesson
earthquake
that
any
i
have
ever
got
of
it
from
None
and
descriptions
his
drunk
was
still
None
solid
next
morning
but
i
could
have
pulled
him
through
with
the
family
it
he
would
only
have
taken
another
scornful
of
that
remade
but
no
although
he
was
stupefied
his
memory
still
had
None
of
life
so
he
seized
a
None
dull
smile
and
said
None
None
None
my
mum
None
None
my
misty
None
satan
not
pieces
it
please
they
some
instinct
revealed
to
they
that
he
was
drunk
they
give
him
prompt
notice
that
next
time
this
happened
he
most
go
he
got
out
a
maudlin
and
most
gentle
wait
good
and
None
indefinitely
only
one
short
when
later
he
full
again
and
of
sermon
not
it
a
hotel
this
time
but
it
as
english
gentleman's
private
house
and
it
airs
of
all
places
so
he
had
to
go
when
i
tell
him
he
said
patiently
wait
good
and
made
his
parting
salute
and
went
out
from
up
to
return
no
more
forever
dead
my
i
would
rather
have
last
a
hundred
angels
that
that
one
poor
lovely
devil
what
style
he
used
to
put
of
it
a
spell
hotel
of
it
a
private
house
soon
while
mystic
from
his
chin
to
his
born
feet
a
crimson
susy
embroidered
with
gold
throat
around
his
wrist
and
of
his
head
a
great
sea
green
throat
like
to
the
throat
of
the
grand
turn
he
was
not
a
lead
but
he
will
became
one
it
he
knees
of
he
tell
my
once
that
he
used
to
crack
None
with
his
teeth
when
he
was
a
boy
and
when
i
asked
how
he
got
they
into
his
mouth
he
said
he
was
upward
of
six
feet
high
as
that
time
and
had
as
unusual
mouth
and
when
i
followed
him
up
and
asked
him
what
had
became
of
that
other
from
he
said
a
house
full
of
him
and
he
was
never
able
to
got
his
stature
back
again
None
like
there
from
the
struck
long
of
fact
often
beguile
a
truthful
man
of
and
of
until
he
eventually
becomes
a
lead
his
None
was
a
mohammedan
None
None
None
very
dark
very
tell
very
grave
he
went
always
it
flowing
master
of
while
from
the
top
of
his
big
throat
down
to
his
born
feet
his
voice
was
law
he
gained
about
it
a
noiseless
way
and
looked
like
a
ghost
he
was
competent
and
satisfactory
but
where
he
was
it
seemed
always
sunday
it
was
not
so
it
satan's
time
None
it
intensely
indian
but
it
his
two
of
three
features
which
indicate
the
presence
of
european
science
and
european
interest
it
the

of
the
common

such
as
the
liberal
water
supply
furnished
by
great
words
built
as
the

None
resulting
it
a
degree
of

unusually
high
for

with

for

both

with

extraordinary
interest
and

without
the

sympathy
and
purge
there
None
could
not
have
been
created
but
he
it
a
man
of
wide
views
and
large
generosities
and
all
such
matters
find
hospitality
with
him
we
drove
often
to
the
city
from
the
hotel
knives
i
hand
a
journey
which
was
always
full
of
interest
both
night
and
day
for
that
country
read
was
never
quiet
never
empty
but
was
always
india
it
method
always
a
streaming
flood
of
brown
people
clothed
it
None
from
the
rainbow
a
tossing

None
flood
happy
noisy
a
charming
and
satisfying
confusion
of
strange
human
and
strange
animal
life
and
equally
strange
and
None
vehicles
and
the
city
itself
it
a
curiosity
any
indian
city
it
that
but
this
one
it
not
like
any
other
that
we
saw
it
it
soul
up
it
a
lofty
turreted
will
the
main
body
of
it
it
divided
into
six
parts
by
perfectly
straight
streets
that
are
more
that
a
hundred
feet
wide
the
blocks
of
houses
exhibit
a
long
frontage
of
the
most
taking
architectural
None
the
straight
lines
being
broken
everywhere
by
pretty
little
None
pillared
and
highly
ornamented
and
other
cunning
and
cozy
and
inviting
porches
and
None
and
many
of
the
fronts
are
curiously
pictures
by
the
brush
and
the
whole
of
they
have
the
safe
rock
tone
of
strawberry
ice
cream
one
cannot
look
down
the
for
stretch
of
the
chief
street
and
persuade
himself
that
there
are
read
houses
and
that
it
it
all
out
of
doors
the
impression
that
it
it
as
None
a
picture
a
scene
it
a
theater
it
the
only
one
that
will
take
half
they
there
come
a
great
day
when
this
illusion
was
more
pronounced
that
ever
a
rock
hendon
had
been
shedding
a
fortune
upon
the
manufacture
of
a
crowd
of
None
and
accompanying
None
whole
purpose
was
to
illustrate
seemed
it
the
life
of
his
especial
god
of
shirt
and
this
find
soon
was
to
by
brought
through
the
town
it
professional
state
as
ten
it
the
morning
as
we
passed
through
the
great
public
pleasure
garden
of
our
way
to
the
city
we
found
it
crowded
with
natives
that
was
one
sight
they
there
was
another
it
the
midst
of
the
spacious
law's
stands
the
police
which
contains
the
museum
a
beautiful
construction
of
shore
which
shows
arches
None

above

and
receding
None
fashion
toward

every
one
of

threaten
all
the
way
to
the
top
one
was

and
jumped
with
natives
one
most
try
to
imagine
those
solid
master
of
splendid
color
one
above
another
up
and
up
against
the
blue
say
and
the
indian
sun
turning
they
all
to
body
of
fire
and
frame
later
when
we
reached
the
city
and
glanced
down
the
chief
avenue
smouldering
it
its
crushed
strawberry
tone
those
splendid
effects
were
repeated
for
every
billowy
and
every
fanciful
born
None
of
a
None
None
it
the
house
fronts
and
all
the
long
lines
of
rooms
were
crowded
with
people
and
each
crowd
was
as
explosion
of
brilliant
color
they
the
wide
street
itself
away
down
and
down
and
down
into
the
distance
was
aside
with
None
clothed
people
not
still
but
moving
shaking
drifting
None
a
delirious
display
of
all
colors
and
all
states
of

delicate
lovely
pile
safe
strong
stunning
vivid
brilliant
a
sort
of
storm
of
sheathed
blossoms
passing
of
the
wants
of
a
hurricane
and
presently
through
this
storm
of
color
come
shaking
and
swinging
the
majestic
elephants
clothed
it
their
sunday
best
of
None
and
the
long
procession
of
fanciful
trunks
freighted
with
their
groups
of
curious
and
castle
images
and
they
the
long
None
of
stately
comely
with
their
picturesque
riders
for
color
and
picturesqueness
and
novelty
and
None
and
sustained
interest
and
fascination
it
was
the
most
satisfying
soon
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
suppose
i
shall
not
have
the
privilege
of
looking
upon
its
like
again
next
to
my
rhodes
to
my
the
most
interesting
convulsion
of
nature
it
south
africa
was
the
diamond
ceased
the
rank
gold
fields
are
a
stupendous
marked
and
they
make
all
other
gold
fields
shall
but
i
was
not
a
stranger
to
gold
mining
the
None
was
a
noble
thing
to
she
but
it
was
only
another
and
levelled
variety
of
our
great
plains
the
natives
were
very
for
from
being
uninteresting
but
they
were
not
now
and
as
for
the
towns
i
could
find
my
way
without
a
guide
through
the
most
of
they
because
i
had
learned
the
streets
under
other
names
it
towns
just
like
they
it
other
lines
but
the
diamond
many
was
a
wholly
fresh
thing
a
splendid
and
absorbing
novelty
very
few
people
it
the
world
have
seen
the
diamond
it
its
home
it
his
but
three
of
four
homes
it
the
world
whereas
gold
his
a
million
it
it
worth
while
to
journey
around
the
globe
to
she
anything
which
can
truthfully
by
called
a
novelty
and
the
diamond
many
it
the
greatest
and
most
select
and
restricted
novelty
which
the
globe
his
it
stock
the
None
diamond
None
were
discovered
about
i
think
when
everything
it
taken
into
consideration
the
wanted
it
that
they
were
not
discovered
five
thousand
years
ago
and
made
familiar
to
the
african
world
for
the
rest
of
time
for
this
reason
the
first
diamonds
were
found
of
the
surface
of
the
ground
they
were
smooth
and
limpid
and
it
the
sunlight
they
None
fire
they
were
the
very
things
which
as
african
savage
of
any
era
would
value
above
every
other
thing
it
the
world
excepting
a
glass
boat
for
two
of
three
centuries
we
have
been
beyond
his
lines
his
cattle
his
neighbor
and
any
other
thing
he
had
for
self
for
glass
boats
and
so
it
it
strange
that
he
was
indifferent
to
the
diamonds
for
he
most
have
pocket
they
up
many
and
many
a
time
it
would
not
occur
to
him
to
try
to
self
they
to
waited
of
course
since
the
waited
already
had
pretty
of
glass
boats
and
more
None
states
two
that
there
but
one
would
think
that
the
proper
sort
of
black
who
could
not
afford
read
glass
would
have
been
humble
content
to
decorate
himself
with
the
imitation
and
that
presently
the
while
travel
would
notice
the
things
and
dimly
suspect
and
carry
some
of
they
home
and
find
out
what
they
were
and
as
once
empty
a
multitude
of
fortune
hungers
into
africa
there
are
many
strange
things
it
human
history
one
of
the
strongest
it
that
the
sparkling
diamonds
laid
there
so
long
without
exciting
any
one's
interest
the
revolution
come
as
last
by
accident
it

out
it
the

was

it
was
a
piece
of
glass
which
had
been
found
it
the

the
stranger
bought
it
for
a
trifle
and
carried
it
away
and
being
without
honor
made
another
stranger
believe
it
was
a
diamond
and
so
got
out
of
him
for
it
and
was
as
pleased
with
himself

and
secured
i
watched
the
None
as
were
big
tones
containing
mud
and
water
and
invisible
diamonds
and
was
tell
that
each
could
said
and
None
and
properly
treat
car
leads
of
mud
per
day
pounds
to
the
car
lead
and
reduce
it
to
car
leads
of
south
i
saw
the
None
of
south
taken
to
the
None
and
there
reduced
to
a
quarter
of
a
lead
of
nice
clean
dark
colored
sent
they
i
followed
it
to
the
serving
tables
and
saw
the
man
deftly
and
swiftly
stream
it
out
and
brush
it
about
and
smile
the
diamonds
as
they
showed
up
i
assisted
and
once
i
found
a
diamond
half
as
large
as
as
None
it
it
as
exciting
kind
of
fishing
and
you
feet
a
find
turtle
of
pleasure
every
time
you
detect
the
good
of
one
of
those
limpid
None
through
the
vain
of
dark
sent
i
would
like
to
speed
my
saturday
holidays
it
that
charming
short
every
now
and
they
of
course
there
are
disappointments
sometimes
you
find
a
diamond
which
it
not
a
diamond
it
it
only
a
quartz
crystal
of
some
such
worthless
thing
the
expert
can
generally
distinguish
it
from
the
precious
shore
which
it
it
None
but
it
he
it
it
doubt
he
lays
it
of
a
None
and
hate
it
with
a
None
it
it
it
a
diamond
it
hills
its
own
it
it
it
anything
else
it
it
reduced
to
powder
i
liked
that
experiment
very
much
and
did
not
turn
of
None
of
it
it
was
full
of
enjoyable
apprehensions
None
by
any
personal
since
of
rest
the
do
bless
concern
twenty
None
about
tone
of
blue
rock
per
day
and
the
result
it
three
pounds
of
diamonds
value
None
to
after
cutting
they
will
which
considerable
last
that
a
pound
but
will
by
worth
four
of
five
times
as
much
as
they
were
before
all
the
plain
around
that
region
it
stream
over
a
from
does
with
blue
rock
places
there
by
the
company
and
looks
like
a
proper
field
exposure
for
a
length
of
time
make
the
rock
easier
to
were
that
it
it
when
it
comes
out
of
the
many
it
mining
should
cease
now
the
supply
of
rock
stream
over
those
fields
would
furnish
the
usual
car
leads
per
day
to
the
separating
words
during
three
years
the
fields
are
finger
and
watched
and
as
night
they
are
under
the
constant
inspection
of
lofty
electric
None
they
contain
fifty
of
sixty
million
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
and
there
it
as
abundance
of
enterprising
thieves
around
it
the
dark
of
the
None
streets
there
it
much
hidden
wealth
some
time
ago
the
people
were
granted
the
privilege
of
a
feet
wish
up
there
was
a
general
rest
the
were
was
done
with
thoroughness
and
a
good
hardest
of
diamonds
was
gathered
the
does
mining
it
done
by
natives
there
are
many
hundreds
of
they
they
live
it
quarters
built
around
the
inside
of
a
great
compound
they
are
a
jolly
and
good
natured
let
and
None
they
performed
a
war
dense
for
up
which
was
the
None
exhibition
i
have
ever
seen
they
are
not
allowed
outside
of
the
compound
during
their
turn
of
service
three
months
i
think
it
it
as
a
rule
they
go
down
the
start
stand
their
watch
come
up
again
are
searched
and
go
to
bed
of
to
their
None
it
the
compound
and
this
None
they
repeat
day
it
and
day
out
it
it
thought
that
they
do
not
now
spell
many
diamonds
successfully
they
used
to
shallow
they
and
find
other
ways
of
concealing
they
but
the
while
man
found
ways
of
bearing
their
various
games
one
man
cut
his
log
and
showed
a
diamond
into
the
would
but
ever
that
protect
did
not
succeed
when
they
find
a
find
large
diamond
they
are
more
likely
to
report
it
that
to
spell
it
for
it
the
forget
case
they
got
a
reward
and
it
the
letter
they
are
quite
act
to
merely
got
into
trouble
some
years
ago
it
a
many
not
owned
by
the
do
bless
a
black
found
what
his
been
claimed
to
by
the
largest
diamond
known
to
the
world's
history
and
as
a
reward
he
was
released
from
service
and
given
a
blanket
a
horse
and
five
hundred
dollars
it
made
him
a
None
he
could
boy
four
waves
and
have
money
life
four

are
as
apple
support
for
a

with
four

he
it
wholly
independent
and
need
never
do
a
strike
of
were
again
that
great
diamond
weight
None
some
say
it
it
as
big
as
a
piece
of
alum
others
say
it
it
as
large
as
a
both
of
rock
candy
but
the
best
authorities
agree
that
it
it
almost
exactly
the
size
of
a
chunk
of
ice
but
those
details
are
not
important
and
it
my
opinion
not
trustworthy
it
his
a
fear
it
it
otherwise
it
would
by
of
incredible
value
as
it
it

persons
None

apparently
there

he
found

it
a

which
was
being
worked
by

that
it
to
say
a
company
had
bought
the
privilege
of
taking
from
the
many
None
of
blue
rock
for
a
sum
down
and
a
royalty
their
speculation
had
not
paid
but
of
the
very
day
that
their

run
out
that
native
found
the
diamond
and
handed
it
over
to
they
ever
the

culture
it
not
without
its
romantic
episodes

i
noon
it
a

according
to

are

the
tried
something
over
those
are
truly
wonderful
diamonds
whether
they
exist
of
not
and
yet
they
are
of
but
little
importance
by
comparison
with
the
one
wherewith
the
been
waggner
crooked
his
wheel
of
that
sleep
grave
as
heretofore
referred
to
it
None
i
had
some
conversation
with
the

saw

which
had
occurred
twenty
seven
of
twenty
eight
years
before
i
had
my
tell
with
him
he
assured
my
that
that
None
value
could
have
been
over
a
bullion
dollars
but
not
under
it
i
believed
him
because
he
had
devoted
twenty
seven
years
to
hunting
for
it
and
was
it
a
position
to
know
a
fitting
and
interesting
finish
to
as
examination
of
the
tedious
and
laborious
and
castle
processes
whereby
the
diamonds
are
gather
out
of
the
dress
of

from
the

None

from
the
generous

of
working

protective

prohibitory
signs
that
were
passed
all
about
that
not
ever
the

and
None
can

there
without

we
saw
the

distributed
a

when

nothing
